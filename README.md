# Demo Over Deck

**An MBA founder toolkit for turning slide deck claims into a live demo URL.**

This repo exists for one reason: most early venture conversations become opinion wars when all you have is slides. A shareable demo link turns the conversation into interaction.

Live site (workshop + demos):
- https://codekunoichi.github.io/demo-over-deck/

## What this is

This is not a coding bootcamp.

I am not here to turn MBA students into software engineers. I am here to turn them into product managers who can build their own prototypes so they can stop guessing and start testing.

## The method

A lightweight loop you can repeat in every course project:

1. Pick a tiny demo app that proves value
2. Sketch the workflow on paper
3. Convert the sketch into a one page intent spec
4. Build the smallest interactive workflow locally
5. Tighten the demo for a 10 minute walkthrough
6. Deploy to a shareable URL
7. Iterate based on feedback

The goal is learning, not polish.

## What you will leave with

- A one page intent spec that clearly describes what you are building
- A minimal working demo that shows one core workflow
- A shareable URL you can send to instructors, teammates, and potential users

## Repo structure

- `docs/`
  - Workshop materials for faculty and students
  - Example demos with sketches, intent specs, prompt sequences, deployment notes, and debugging notes
- `apps/`
  - Self contained demo apps (each deployable on its own)

## Toolchain

Use the smallest toolchain that gets you to a demo URL.

Recommended:
- AI coding assistant: Claude Code or Codex
- Code editor: VS Code
- Version control: GitHub
- Deployment: Netlify

Free tiers are sufficient for early demos.

## Guardrails

- Treat AI tools as public by default
- Do not enter proprietary, sensitive, or real patient data
- Disclose which AI tools were used
- Verify your demo end to end
- Grade thinking and iteration, not code complexity
