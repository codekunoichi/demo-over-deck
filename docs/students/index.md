## Purpose
This workshop helps student founders move from idea to a working demo quickly so they can learn faster, get feedback earlier, and communicate value more clearly.

This is not a coding bootcamp. The goal is to reduce slide-driven ambiguity by introducing a simple, repeatable method for building early MVPs.

## What you will leave with
By the end of the workshop, you will have:
- A one-page intent spec that clearly describes what you are building
- A minimal working demo that shows one core workflow
- A shareable URL you can send to instructors, teammates, and potential users

## The workflow
The method follows a lightweight loop:

1. Pick a tiny demo app that proves value
2. Sketch the workflow on paper
3. Convert the sketch into an intent spec
4. Build the smallest interactive workflow locally
5. Tighten the demo for a 10-minute walkthrough
6. Deploy to a shareable URL
7. Iterate based on feedback

The goal is learning, not polish.

## Step 0: Pick a tiny demo app
Choose something that can be demonstrated end to end in 10 minutes.

Good options include:
- A landing page with a waitlist
- A pricing calculator
- A simple customer discovery tracker

Pick one idea. Do not build multiple features.

## Step 1: Sketch the workflow on paper
Before opening any coding tool, draw the workflow on paper.

Sketch:
- Who the user is
- What the first screen looks like
- What the user clicks
- What happens next
- What success looks like at the end of the flow

You may photograph the sketch and use it as reference when writing your intent spec.

## Step 2: Turn the sketch into an intent spec
Write a one-page intent spec in plain language.

An intent spec answers:
- Who is the user?
- What problem are we solving?
- What is the smallest workflow that proves value?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What does success look like in a 10-minute demo?

You may use ChatGPT or Claude to ask clarifying questions before building.

## Step 3: Build one core workflow locally
Use an AI-assisted coding tool to build only the most important workflow.

Focus on:
- One user
- One task
- One completed loop

Static pages are acceptable for secondary features. The goal is clarity.

## Step 4: Tighten the demo
Prepare a demo that is easy to follow and hard to break.

Do the following:
- Write a 10-step demo script describing what you will click
- Remove features not needed for the demo
- Add simple validation and friendly empty states
- Test the demo from a fresh browser session

## Step 5: Publish to a shareable URL
Deploy the demo to a public URL so others can try it.

A shareable link turns conversations from opinions into interaction.

## Toolchain
Use the smallest toolchain that gets you to a demo URL.

Recommended:
- AI coding assistant: Claude Code or Codex
- Code editor: VS Code
- Version control: GitHub
- Deployment: Netlify

Free tiers are sufficient for early demos.

## Managing AI limits and staying productive
AI tools may hit usage limits. Plan for this.

When you hit a limit, switch to non-coding tasks:
- Rewrite your intent spec for clarity
- Improve your demo script
- Draft the demo narrative
- Collect one piece of user feedback
- Decide what features to cut and why

Return to building with a clearer plan.

## The 48-hour challenge
After the workshop, you may choose to complete an optional 48-hour challenge.

Deliverables:
- A one-page intent spec
- A working demo link
- A short demo script
- A brief reflection on what was cut and why
- At least one piece of external feedback that informed a change

## What counts as done
Done means:
- A working demo that walks the core workflow
- At least one piece of external feedback that informed a change

Complexity is not rewarded. Learning and clarity are.

## Guardrails
- Treat AI tools as public by default
- Do not enter proprietary, sensitive, or real patient data
- Disclose which AI tools were used
- Verify your demo end to end
- Grade thinking and iteration, not code complexity
