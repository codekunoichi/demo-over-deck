## Purpose
This workshop is designed to help student founders move from idea to a working demo quickly so they can learn faster, get feedback earlier, and communicate value more clearly.

This is not a coding bootcamp. It is a way to reduce slide-driven ambiguity by introducing a simple, repeatable method for building early MVPs.

## Why demo URLs beat slides
Slide decks are useful for storytelling, but they often hide uncertainty. A working demo forces clarity. It reveals what actually exists, what is missing, and what assumptions were wrong.

A shareable demo URL allows instructors, peers, and potential users to interact with the idea directly instead of imagining it.

## The method
The workshop uses a lightweight, repeatable loop:

1. Clarify the problem and the user
2. Write an intent spec in plain language
3. Build the thinnest interactive workflow
4. Deploy to a shareable URL
5. Iterate based on feedback

The goal is learning, not polish.

## Step 1: Write an intent spec
Before writing any code, describe the idea clearly in natural language.

An intent spec answers:
- Who is the user?
- What problem are we solving?
- What is the smallest workflow that proves value?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What does success look like in a 10-minute demo?

This step forces clarity and prevents feature sprawl.

## Step 2: Build one core workflow
Using AI-assisted coding tools, build only the most important workflow.

Focus on:
- One user
- One task
- One completed loop

Static pages are acceptable for secondary features. The goal is to demonstrate value, not completeness.

## Step 3: Deploy to a shareable link
Once the core workflow works locally, deploy it to a public URL.

A shareable link allows others to interact with the idea directly and makes feedback concrete. Version control provides a history of how the idea evolved.

## The 48-hour challenge
After the workshop, students may choose to participate in an optional 48-hour challenge.

Deliverables:
- A one-page intent spec
- A working demo link
- A short demo script describing what to click
- A brief reflection on what was cut and why

## What counts as done
Done means:
- A working demo that walks the core workflow
- At least one piece of external feedback that informed a change

Complexity is not rewarded. Learning and clarity are.

## Guardrails
- Treat AI tools as public by default
- Do not enter proprietary, sensitive, or real patient data
- Disclose which AI tools were used
- Grade thinking and iteration, not code complexity
