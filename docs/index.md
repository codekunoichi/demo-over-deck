# From Slide Deck to Live Demo

A short seminar for entrepreneurship faculty and students on using AI-assisted prototyping to move from ideas to working demos faster.

## One‑sentence takeaway
A live demo URL creates learning, clarity, and credibility faster than twenty slides.

## Why this exists
Most early ventures spend too long explaining ideas and too little time testing them.
This seminar shows a repeatable pattern: use AI as a *build accelerator* to create lightweight, testable demos that surface real product questions early.

## What this seminar is
- A practical pattern for venture learning using AI‑assisted prototyping
- A way to turn vague ideas into something users can react to
- A bridge between product thinking and technical execution

## What this seminar is not
- Not a traditional coding workshop
- Not a lecture on AI theory
- Not about replacing engineers

The goal is to help founders, PMs, and students **think better by building sooner**.

## Featured example: HEP Tracker
As a concrete walkthrough, this site includes a real demo built end‑to‑end:

**HEP Tracker** – a lightweight Home Exercise Program compliance tracker  
Built from:
- A spreadsheet sketch
- A clear intent document
- AI‑guided implementation
- Deployed as a live Netlify app

You can explore:
- The original sketch
- The prompt sequence used with Claude
- The Netlify deployment and debugging trail
- The final working demo

## Who this is for
- Faculty teaching entrepreneurship, venture design, or product management
- Students and founders who want to pitch with a working demo
- Anyone curious how AI changes early‑stage product discovery

## Core idea to remember
If your idea fits in a spreadsheet, it can probably fit in a demo.
And once it’s a demo, learning accelerates.
