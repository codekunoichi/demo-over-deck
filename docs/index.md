# From Slide Deck to Demo URL

A short seminar for entrepreneurship faculty and students on using AI-assisted prototyping to accelerate venture learning.

## One sentence takeaway
A shareable demo URL teaches more than twenty slides.

## What this seminar is
This is not a coding workshop.
This is a venture learning acceleration pattern that helps teams validate and communicate value earlier through working demos.

## Who this is for
- Faculty teaching entrepreneurship, new venture design, and venture labs
- Student founders who want to pitch with a working prototype instead of a deck
