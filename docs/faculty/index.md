## Purpose
Help student teams replace slide-driven ambiguity with a working demo URL by mid-term.

## Origin story
In 2019 Lab to Market at UCSD, most teams had strong ideas but lacked engineers, so many projects lived and died inside slide decks.
In my own work on ContextRCM, I saw the opposite. A simple static HTML demo built with AI assistance created instant clarity and stronger user feedback than slides ever could.

## The behavior change
By mid-term, every team produces a working demo URL that becomes the artifact for feedback and iteration.

## Method
1. Intent spec
2. Build the thinnest interactive workflow
3. Deploy to a shareable URL
4. Iterate based on feedback

## What “done” looks like
A working demo that walks the core workflow, plus at least one piece of external feedback that informed a change.

## Guardrails
- Treat AI tools as public by default
- No proprietary or sensitive data
- Disclose AI assistance
- Grade thinking and iteration, not code complexity

## January student workshop preview
A hands-on session that teaches the same method, followed by an optional 48-hour challenge.
